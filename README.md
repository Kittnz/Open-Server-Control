Project Scope
-------------------
The Open Server Control Panel Project is determined to create a web-based gameserver control panel that is OpenSource, Free, and Platform Independent using C#, C, PHP, and MySQL.

In the front-end panel upon completion will allow you to manage your gameservers on multiple hosts on ONE central site by allowing the users to:
- start, stop and restart servers
- mange server files and configurations
- manage server console (if applicable)
- install mods for specific gameservers
- create subusers that will be allowed certain permissions specified.

The panel will also include administration which will allow you to:
- add/remove users
- edit user permissions and access to specific servers
- un/install servers 
- move servers (from and to the same OS)
- add hosts (linux or windows)

The project is going to original focus on the Windows and Linux platforms, but if you are willing to work on a server monitor just contact any of the contributors.
